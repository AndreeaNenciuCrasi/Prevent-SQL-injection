# SQL Injection

The goal of this assignment is twofold:

## Break the DB interface of the webpage

Find ways to change the underlying database in unintended ways.
For example drop a table.

Write your solutions into `sqlInjection.txt`.

## Fix the DB interface of the webpage

Change the implementation of the application in a way
so that the attacks found above don't work anymore.

The Java SQL API has a solution for this.
Try to find and apply it.
